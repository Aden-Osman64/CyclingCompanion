Project Structure
This project is a standard Gradle-based Android application.

app/: Contains the main application source code.

build.gradle.kts: Top-level Gradle build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.

gradle/wrapper/: Contains the Gradle wrapper files.

gradlew (for Unix/macOS) and gradlew.bat (for Windows): Scripts to execute Gradle tasks without a local Gradle installation.

gradle.properties: Project-wide Gradle settings, including JVM arguments for the daemon process and AndroidX configurations.

settings.gradle.kts: Configures the project's repositories and declares included modules.

local.properties: Specifies the location of the Android SDK on your local machine. This file is automatically generated and should not be committed to version control.

Getting Started
To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have a JDK installed. The gradlew and gradlew.bat scripts require JAVA_HOME to be set in your environment variables, pointing to your Java installation.

Android SDK: The project relies on the Android SDK. Its location is specified in local.properties.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/CycleCompanion.git
cd CycleCompanion

Open in Android Studio:
It is recommended to open the project in Android Studio. Android Studio will automatically handle the initial Gradle sync and download necessary dependencies.

Building and Running the Project
You can build the project using the Gradle wrapper or run it directly from Android Studio.

Building with Gradle
On Windows:

.\gradlew.bat build

On Unix/macOS:

./gradlew build

Running in Android Studio
Open the project: If not already open, open the CycleCompanion project in Android Studio.

Select a device: In the Android Studio toolbar, select a virtual device (emulator) or a physical Android device connected to your computer.

Run the app: Click the green "Run 'app'" button (a green triangle icon) in the toolbar. Android Studio will build the application and deploy it to your selected device.

Technologies Used
Kotlin: A modern, concise, and safe programming language for Android development.

Jetpack Compose: Android's modern toolkit for building native UI. The kotlin-compose plugin is used in this project.

Gradle: The build automation tool used for Android projects.

AndroidX: A collection of libraries that helps you build great Android apps.

Configuration Details
Gradle JVM Arguments: The org.gradle.jvmargs in gradle.properties is set to -Xmx2048m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8, which specifies the JVM arguments used for the Gradle daemon process, particularly useful for memory settings.

AndroidX: android.useAndroidX=true is enabled in gradle.properties, indicating the use of AndroidX libraries.

Non-Transitive R Classes: android.nonTransitiveRClass=true is set, which enables namespacing of each library's R class, reducing its size.

Kotlin Code Style: The kotlin.code.style is set to official.

Plugin Management: The settings.gradle.kts file defines the repositories for plugin management, including gradlePluginPortal(), google(), and mavenCentral(). It also includes a content filter for google() to include specific group IDs like com.android.*, com.google.*, and androidx.*.

Dependency Resolution: Dependencies are resolved from google() and mavenCentral() repositories, with repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS) enabled.
